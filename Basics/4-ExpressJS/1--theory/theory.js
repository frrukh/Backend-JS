// NODE JS VS EXPRESS JS.
    // Node JS has a package called HTTP that is used to create a server.
    // express is also used to create server.
    // but we use express js because it is easy to use, but at the end of the day the code written in express js converts into that HTTP package code, so express js helps us to write less code to create server with HTTP.

    // node is the main thing, but we can write the server code and how server react using express js.

// WHY EXPRESS?
    // because HTTP of node is difficult to use.
