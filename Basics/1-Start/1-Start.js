// There are some vary basic things you should know about.

// 1) HOW INTERNET WORKS TO DELIVER YOUR MESSAGES?
    // when we send a message, some packets (of rays) comes out from our mobile/device and go to the nearest ISP(Internet Service Provider) tower, on ISP tower your packets are converted into electric signals to move them to a long journey i.e towards the nearest tower to the person where you sent the message and at there these electric signals again converted into digital signals i.e. packets and goes to that person's device. in this way the communication works. This process of conversion is essential because the digital signals are not capable to cover a long distance.

// 2) WHAT IS A SERVER?
    // A server is normal computer that is programmed to receive request and send the response.

// 3) WHAT IS CLIENT SERVER ARCHITECTURE?
    // the client send a request to the server and the server process the request and send the response, this is client server architecture.

// 4) HOW ROUTER WORKS?
    // The router operates every device connected to it through mac address,when a device of mac address "abc" sends a message the router receives it in the form of packets and converts it into electric singles and when the response came back from the other side, response comes in the router now router checks, for which mac address this response is? and delivers it to that mac address.

// 5) WHAT ARE HTTP AND HTTPS PROTOCOLS?
    // HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
    // HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure.

    // Protocol:
        // A protocol, in general, is a set of rules that determines how data is transmitted and received between devices in a network. It defines the format and order of messages exchanged between the devices, ensuring that they can understand and interpret each other's communications correctly. So, HTTP specifies how web browsers and servers should communicate to request and deliver web pages and other resources on the internet.

    // HTTP is not a software but rather a set of rules or guidelines that govern how information is exchanged between web servers and clients (such as web browsers). In simpler terms, it's a protocol for communication between computers over the internet.

    // HTTP and HTTPS are protocols used for transferring data over the internet. HTTP is used for communication between web servers and clients (like web browsers), while HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts data to ensure confidentiality and integrity during transmission, commonly used for secure online transactions and sensitive data exchange.
